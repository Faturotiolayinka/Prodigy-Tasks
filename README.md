### ✅ **Task 1: World Population Data Visualization**

**Objective:** Explore, visualize, and compare population trends across different countries and years using historical data.

**Dataset:** World Bank population data (`API_SP_cleaned_dataset.csv`) with population figures for years such as 1960, 1990, 2010, 2022, and 2023.

**Key Tasks:**

* Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas.
* Visualized population distributions using:

  * Histograms to observe general trends across selected years.
  * Pair plots for multivariate analysis of selected countries.
  * Bar plots to highlight top populated countries by year.
* Identified population trends and growth patterns using time-based comparisons.

**Tools & Libraries:**
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Data wrangling, comparative visual analysis, historical trend evaluation, and insightful plotting using real-world data.

### ✅ **Task 2: Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression**

**Objective:** Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using logistic regression, and perform data cleaning and analysis.

**Dataset:** Titanic dataset (`Titanic-Dataset.csv`)

**Key Tasks:**

* Performed data cleaning:

  * Handled missing values (e.g., replaced missing Age values with the mean)
  * Dropped less relevant columns like "Cabin"
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and key survival factors.
* Trained a **Logistic Regression** model using Scikit-learn.
* Evaluated model performance using **accuracy score**.

**Tools & Libraries:**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Data preprocessing, feature selection, binary classification using logistic regression, and evaluation of model performance.

### ✅ **Task 3: Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree & Ensemble Models**

**Objective:** Build a classifier to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their demographics and behavior.

**Dataset:** Bank marketing dataset (`Bank_Additional.csv`)

**Key Tasks:**

* Loaded and inspected data, checked for nulls and duplicates.
* Performed data visualization to understand feature distributions (e.g., job type).
* Preprocessed the dataset using encoding and scaling as needed.
* Built and compared several models:

  * **Decision Tree**
  * **Random Forest**
  * **Logistic Regression**
* Evaluated models using:

  * Accuracy score
  * Confusion matrix
  * F1-score
  * Classification report

**Tools & Libraries:**
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Supervised learning (classification), ensemble modeling, performance metrics interpretation, and customer behavior analysis.
